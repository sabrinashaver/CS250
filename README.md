**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**
  Intepreting user needs means understanding what the user really wants to achieve, not just what they say they want. This often involves asking clarifying questions, observing workflows or problems, and thinking critically about how technology can help. Once that information is gathered, the user needs can be translated into specific features or behaviors that the end program should have.
  User stories are helpful because they keep the focus on the user, are written in plain language ("As a [user], I want [something] so that [benefit]"), help the team break big ideas down into manageable tasks, and guide both design and testing, clarifying the "definition of done".
_Example: "As a traveler, I want to save my favorite destinations so I can easily plan repeat trips."_
  This tell you the need (save favorites), the user (traveler), and the purpose (easy trip planning). From here, you decide how it looks technically. It might mean creating a user profile, a database table, and a UI feature to "heart" destinations.


**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**
A solid approach to development involves:
- Understanding the problem/user needs through research, user stories, or other methods.
- Planning out features, priorities, and architecture.
- Iterating - incremental builds, testing, feedback.
- Refactoring, or improving the code as you go.
- Testing and deployment.
Agile processes I hope to incorporate into my future development work:
- Sprints - short development cycles to keep momentum and focus.
- Daily standups - brief team check-ins.
- Sprint planning and retrospectives - what are we doing, and how did we do?
- Backlogs - prioritized to-do lists of user stories or tasks.
- Pair programming / Code reviews - for learning and quality control.
- Continuous integration - frequently updating and testing code.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**
  Being a good team member is more than writing good code. It means communicating clearly and often, being dependable, listening well, being open to learning and collaboration, helping others, and respecting team processes. Being a good team member is about trust, communication, and shared goals.
